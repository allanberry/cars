# Cars

This is an attempt to explore some new technologies.  It's definitely a work in progress, and will take some time to mature.

Thanks for visiting.


## To get running

1. In `cars`: `python app.py`, to start the main Flask app
2. In `cars`: `mongod`, to start the database
3. In `adminMongo`: `npm start` (optional: for starting AdminMongo, a DB browser)
